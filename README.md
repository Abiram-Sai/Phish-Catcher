 **Phish Catcher: Client-Side Defence Against Web Spoofing Attacks Using Machine Learning**

Phish Catcher is a machine learning-powered desktop application built to detect phishing URLs based on intelligent URL feature analysis. Designed as a client-side defense system, it helps users analyze, classify, and guard against web spoofing attacks with high accuracy.

---

## üöÄ Project Summary

Phish Catcher utilizes a robust combination of URL-based feature extraction and machine learning models to classify web links as either **legitimate** or **phishing**. It provides a **Tkinter-based user interface** that enables seamless dataset uploads, real-time URL testing, and visualization of model performance. The tool demonstrates comparative analysis using **SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** classifiers.

## ‚úÖ Features

-  Upload and visualize URL datasets with label distributions  
-  Automatic URL parsing and custom feature extraction (dots, slashes, symbols, etc.)  
-  Train and evaluate models: **SVM**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**  
-  Display confusion matrix and metric scores (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
-  Graphical performance comparison of all classifiers  
-  Predict legitimacy of new URLs in real-time
